WP Auto Update Plugins is a lightweight plugin to enable automatic updating of plugins.

== Description ==

Lightweight plugin to auto update plugins. Once active, no setup is required! Your site will now auto update plugins.

= Not working or a bug? =
If you run into an issue please let us know in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-auto-update-plugins) before leaving a low review, we are very active in updating plugins and everything we produce.

= Why didn't you add automatic theme updates? =
Although this is great functionality in a perfect world, it is not smart to automatically update your wordpress theme, your theme is the face of your website and if it broke due to an auto update, you may not ever know until you check the site again, and plus, you should never update your theme without backing up the site first. This plugin does one thing and does it well. Update plugins, and thats it!

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
